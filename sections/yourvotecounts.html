    <h1> Your voice is your most powerful weapon. In this country your voice is your vote, so use it. </h1>
    <p><span>T</span>here are several people out there in this country that don't like their voting options and choose not to vote at all. I'll give you three reasons why you should <b>NOT</b> be one of them.</p>
    
    <div class="row">
  <div class="column" style="background-color:#aaa;">
    <h2>Reason 1 </h2>
    <p> In 2018 nobody though that a top notch business man would win the presidential election, but also nobody wanted to vote for Hillary (no offense to her fans out there) and it is that very reason that Donald Trump won. People were so negligent in voting because of their ill sense of coming to terms with reality that we ended up with a orange person in office that when given the chance to lead this country out of a pandemic chose the selfish option instead and went golfing. I get it. Our options may not be the best, however we got to make the best of what options we do have and the facts say that another 4 years of foolishment and we won't survive.</p>

  <div class="column" style="background-color:#bbb;">
    <h2>Reason 2</h2>
    <p>Even if your votee doesn't win at the end of the day you chose that person and had a hand in them making it as far as they did. So when you look up who's all running in your area and find that one special person that deserves your vote, think of it like the Bachelor's and your giving that chosen nominee your rose (or vote in this case). A very special moment that you should go through with and not upset your viewers by dramatically running away from the polls. Yeah I went there.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column" style="background-color:#ccc;">
    <h2>Reason 3</h2>
    <p>The constituion gives us several rights. We get to make a right turn when the light is red. We get to walk around with guns now. People can have emotional support animals. We have the right to free speech and a "fair trial" . And whether you realize it or not we practice these rights on a daily basis, so whats so different about practicing your right to vote? Nothing that's what so keep that in mind next time your reading the New York Times (just saying).</p>
