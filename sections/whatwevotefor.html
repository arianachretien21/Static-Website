<h1>Did you know that there is more than the presidential election going on?</h1>
    <p> Apart of the presidential election there is also the general election. The general election is where the general public vote for majority/all of the politcal body that represents said public. The chart below categorizes the different political representations up for voting this year. It list how long those people will be in office so keep that in mind when voting if you're just looking for a short term solution not realizing that you're creating a long term problem. The American people deserve better than that.</p>
