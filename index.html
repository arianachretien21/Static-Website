  <h1> Welcome to my 2020 voting informational website!</h1>
  <p> The year is 2020 and there have been aliens, disheartening celebrity deaths, wild fires (still going on by the way), a pandemic (also still going on by the way), protests, racial injustice, racist justification, and now to close the year out it's time to pick a president that will lead this wonderfully made country *note the sarcasm* for the next 4 years!</p>
  <p> Now we aren't going to get to deep into the political world because for why? But the important message of all is to <b class = "red"> VOTE</b>. <b>PERIOD</b>.</p>
<p> This website is going to present you the facts of what this election is all about. On this website we're not worried about your political view, but whether or not you understand that this is more than just a presidential election. It's an election where you take the opportunity to vote for your rights and use your voice as your weapon against the cruelties of the government (whatever you think those are). Our ancestors, (white or black, man or woman) have fought hard for our rights and it would be ignorant for us to not take advantage of that.</p>
